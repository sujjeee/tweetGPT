## Introduction
ThreadsGPT is a web application that generates tweets/threads ideas for users based on their desired tone and type of tweets/threads. Users can set the tone of their tweets/threads to be casual, professional, funny, sarcastic, and more. Additionally, they can choose the type of tweets/threads they want to generate, such as a regular tweets/threads, a retweet, or a reply tweet/threads. So set the vibe and the type of tweets/threads you want, and let the power of OpenAI GPT-3 do the rest.
